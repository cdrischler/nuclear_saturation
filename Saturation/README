      The subdirectory "Saturation" was created with the sole purpose
      of quantifying the predictions of the various models optimized
      by Wei-Chia. To so, the process is as follows:

      (a) In subdirectory WeiChia/RMFModels/FSUGarnet execute the
          script Sampling.com to create 10,000 configurations that
          are distributed according to the covariance matrix.
      (b) Copy the Sampling.out file to the subdirectory:
          Saturation/FSUGarnet and execute ../Saturation.x   
          This step simple replaces kFermi with the density.
      (c) Input averages, std-deviations, and correlation coefficient
          for the density and E/A in Covariance.com to generate the 39% 
	  and 95% confidence ellipses.

	  The reference to FSUGarnet above is just as an example. 
	  Do the same for each covariance EDF of interest.
