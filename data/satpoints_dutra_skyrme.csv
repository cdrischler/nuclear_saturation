# nuclear saturation points for Skyrme interactions
# data from Table I in Brown & Schwenk, https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3957
# There's a typo in the row with SQMC700
# data based on Table VII in https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3902
# Alex Brown changed the underlying interactions, so this table should refer only to the work by Dutra et al.
