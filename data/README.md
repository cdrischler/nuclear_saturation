## Results from Schunck et al.

Mike redid the analysis of the 2015 paper with better actual data. This was
published in J. Phys. G 47, 074001 (2020),
https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6471/ab8745.

Communication with Mike in May/June 2022:

> I am sending the bivariate posterior samples from rho_sat—E^NM from the 2021 paper (the same parameters as rho_c—E^NM/A from the 2015 paper).
> 
> Attached are 3 csv files. One for the samples from each of the three configurations (I only sent the results from the non-truncated set from the paper - see Section 4.2. If you want the samples from the truncated set, I can send them, though they are very similar as indicated in that paper). 
>
> The key result from that paper was that the results were insensitive to the configuration, so lumping samples from the across the three configurations is reasonable, but I figured I'd send separately so you could choose how to Ihandle them.
